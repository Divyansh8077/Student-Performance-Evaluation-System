# Student-Performance-Evaluation-System
## Introduction
An AI-powered educational analytics platform that automates student performance evaluation through intelligent ranking, personalized learning paths, real-time predictions, and course recommendations. It leverages machine learning, graph algorithms, and a modular design to deliver accurate, unbiased, and holistic insights.


## 🚀Features
🔢 Smart Ranking System
Leverages the Quick Sort algorithm to dynamically rank students based on a weighted composite of academic metrics.

🧭 Optimized Learning Paths
Uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to recommend the most efficient course sequences tailored to individual learning goals.

🧠 AI-Powered Student Classification
Applies machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees) to categorize students into performance tiers for targeted support.

📚 Personalized Course Recommendations
Recommends relevant courses based on academic history, performance trends, and career objectives.

📈 Real-Time Analytics & Feedback
Continuously monitors and visualizes performance data to provide timely insights for students and educators.

🛡️ Fair & Automated Evaluation
Ensures a transparent, bias-free, and low-effort assessment process by minimizing manual intervention.
